This repository is for homework 3 for STAT 159 at UC Berkeley. It mainly makes ligotools an installable package, adds tests that can be run with pytest ligotools, and creates a page/makefile.
All code was written by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the repository structure (and features listed above) were done by Aniket Kamat.
